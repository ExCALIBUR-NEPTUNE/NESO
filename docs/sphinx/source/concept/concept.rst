Introduction
============

NESO (Neptune Exploratory SOftware) is an experimental codebase
for combining high order finite elements, from `Nektar++ <https://www.nektar.info/>`_,
with the performance portable particle framework
`NESO-Particles <https://github.com/ExCALIBUR-NEPTUNE/NESO-Particles>`_ to solve
plasma physics problems for tokamak exhausts at the exascale. Other satellite repositories
include:
 - `NESO-Spack <https://github.com/ExCALIBUR-NEPTUNE/NESO-Spack>`_ for installation.
 - `NESO-Reactions <https://github.com/ExCALIBUR-NEPTUNE/NESO-Reactions>`_ for neutral, atomic and molecular dependencies.
 - `NESO-UQ <https://github.com/ExCALIBUR-NEPTUNE/NESO-UQ>`_ for uncertainty quantification dependencies.

This is a work in progress, but please do engage with us via issues etc.
