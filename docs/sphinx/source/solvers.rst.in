####################
Solvers and examples
####################

Building NESO with configuration option ``-DNESO_BUILD_SOLVERS=ON`` will generate a number of solver executables that can be used to run example simulations.
Note that this option is turned on by default, but is disabled when building NESO via spack with the ``+libonly`` variant.

Source code for each solver is in ``solvers/<solver_name>`` and input files for the solver examples can be found in ``examples/<solver_name>``.
Note that these examples are intended to demonstrate various features of the NESO library, rather than to simulate particular scenarios of interest in plasma physics.
The solver source codes also act as potential starting points for constructing new applications.

More general instructions for :ref:`running solvers<run_eg>` and :ref:`modifying example meshes<geo_to_xml>` can be found towards the end of this section. 
The following subsections describe the solvers and accompanying examples that are currently available in NESO.

.. _run_eg:

****************
Running a solver
****************

While each solver executable can be used directly, the simplest way to run a solver example is using the ``run_eg.sh`` script.
This ensures all required input files are copied to a new directory (``runs/<solver_name>/<examples_name>``) and that the correct command is executed.
To run the script from the repository root, use:

   <RUN_EG_USAGE>

Note that the number of MPI processes can be set via a command line flag, and defaults to 4.
The script assumes the intended ``mpirun`` executable is on your path and looks for solver executables in the most recently modified spack "view" directory.
To use a different solver executable, supply the build directory or install directory as described.

   Caution: When running with (MPI and) OpenMP, a value must be set for the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable.
   If `OMP_NUM_THREADS` isn't set, the number of threads will be chosen automatically, typically resulting in one thread per logical core.
   This often leads to oversubscription of cores and slow simulations. It usually makes sense to execute

   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

   before running an example.


.. _geo_to_xml:

************************
Modifying example meshes
************************

All examples in the repository include a Nektar++-compatible XML mesh.
Users that wish to modify those meshes, or create new ones for other applications can use ``geo_to_xml.sh``.
The script takes a ``.geo`` file as input, and uses `gmsh <https://gmsh.info>`_ and ``NekMesh`` to convert it to .xml.
To run the script from the repository root, use:

   <GEO_TO_XML_USAGE>

Both ``gmsh`` and ``NekMesh`` are expected to be on the path.
Note that, if NESO was installed with spack, then ``NekMesh`` should already be built.
Run 

   spack find -l nektar

to see which versions of Nektar++ are available, along with their 7-digit hashes, then

   export PATH=$PATH:$(spack location -i nektar/[hash])/bin

to add the Nektar++ binaries, including NekMesh, to your path.
